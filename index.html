                Abuja, the capital city of Nigeria, is a modern and vibrant metropolis located in the heart of the country.
                Established in 1991 as the capital, Abuja was purpose-built to replace Lagos, offering a more centralized
                location for governance and administration. The city is renowned for its well-planned infrastructure, wide roads,
                and iconic landmarks such as Aso Rock, the Nigerian National Mosque, and the National Christian Centre.
                Abuja's serene environment, coupled with its lush greenery and hilly landscapes, makes it a stark contrast 
                to the bustling energy of Lagos.As a hub for politics, commerce, and international diplomacy, 
                Abuja is home to government institutions, embassies, and a diverse population.
                Its blend of urban development and natural beauty creates a unique atmosphere, 
                making it one of Africa's most prominent cities.
